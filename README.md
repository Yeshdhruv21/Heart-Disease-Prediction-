# Heart-Disease-Prediction-
•	Built a binary classification model using logistic regression to predict risk of cardiovascular diseases 
•	Performed data imputations using KNN imputer and feature scaling to normalize the data for further analysis 
•	Dealt with Class Imbalance using different resampling techniques such as SMOTE and under sampling 
•	Implemented backward elimination (p-value approach) to select only significant features for the response variable 
•	Obtained the model of best fit with sensitivity = 0.577, specificity = 0.6315 and F1 score = 0.74
